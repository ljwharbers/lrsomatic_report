# lrsomatic_report

Standalone reporting tool for the [LRSomatic](https://github.com/nf-core/lrsomatic) Nextflow pipeline. Generates a self-contained HTML report per sample with:

- **Summary header**: purity, ploidy, coverage, N50, variant counts
- **Circos plot**: somatic SNVs (6-class SBS colours), non-BND SVs, ASCAT copy number, translocation links
- **Interactive variant table**: VEP-annotated somatic small variants, optionally filtered to a gene panel, with VAF, depth and phasing
- **Interactive SV table**: Severus structural variants annotated with gene overlaps, sharing the same gene-panel filter
- **Phasing**: per-chromosome WhatsHap statistics (germline)
- **QC details**: mosdepth coverage, samtools flagstat, cramino read stats

## Quick start

```bash
S=/path/to/CCS15-ONT

Rscript bin/render_report.R \
  --sample-dir  $S \
  --sample-id   CCS15-ONT \
  --sex         male \
  --reference   auto            # auto-detects t2t vs hg38 from VCF headers
```

The output file `CCS15-ONT_report.html` will be written to the current directory.

Matched and tumour-only runs take the same command: the run mode and every input file
are discovered from the sample directory.

Tables render unfiltered. Add `--gene-panel lymphoid` (or a path to your own TSV) to have a
panel selected when the report opens — see [Gene panels](#gene-panels).

## All options

```
--sample-dir   Path to the sample output directory (required)
--sample-id    Sample identifier (default: directory name)
--reference    t2t | hg38 | auto  (default: auto)
--sex          male | female | XY | XX  (required)
--gene-panel   none | builtin panel name (e.g. lymphoid) | path to a custom TSV
               (default: none — tables render unfiltered)
--output       Output HTML path  (default: <sample-id>_report.html in current dir)
--title        Report title
```

> **Changed in v1.1.0:**
> - `--mode` and `--somatic-vcf` were removed. Run mode is derived from whether normal-side
>   QC is present, and the VCF supplying VAF is now discovered (see below), so neither needs
>   to be declared. Scripts passing them will fail on an unknown option.
> - `--gene-panel` now defaults to `none` instead of `lymphoid`: reports open unfiltered
>   unless a panel is asked for. Pass `--gene-panel lymphoid` to restore the old default.

## Gene panels

Reports are **unfiltered by default**. `--gene-panel` only chooses which panel is selected when
the report opens; the rendered HTML always contains every variant and every builtin panel, so a
reader can switch panels (or paste a custom gene list) in the browser without re-rendering.

Built-in panels live in `assets/gene_lists/`. Each is a TSV with a `gene` column (HGNC symbols).

| Panel | Description |
|---|---|
| `lymphoid` | ~70 recurrently mutated genes in B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL, FL, CLL, MCL, BL, MALT) |

```bash
--gene-panel lymphoid                # open with the builtin lymphoid panel applied
--gene-panel /path/to/my_genes.tsv   # must have a 'gene' column or be a single-column file
```

A `--gene-panel` value that is neither `none`, a builtin name, nor an existing file is an error —
a typo will not silently produce an unfiltered report.

## Expected input layout

The `--sample-dir` must be the root of a single-sample LRSomatic output. Files are discovered
**recursively** by their distinctive filename suffix, so they can be nested in any directory
structure underneath it — for example:

```
CCS15-ONT/
├── *_SOMATIC_VEP.vcf.gz                                 VEP-annotated somatic small variants
├── variants/phased/somatic_smallvariants.vcf.gz         VAF / depth / phasing source
├── severus_somatic.vcf.gz                               Severus SV calls
├── *_SV_VEP.vcf.gz                                      VEP-annotated SVs
├── *.segments_raw.txt, *.purityploidy.txt               ASCAT
├── *.mosdepth.summary.txt, *.mosdepth.global.dist.txt   mosdepth (tumour)
├── *_cramino.txt, *.flagstat, *.stats                   cramino / samtools (tumour)
├── qc/whatshap_stats/*_whatshap_stats.tsv               phasing statistics (germline)
├── wakhan/                                              Wakhan copy-number solutions
└── **/normal/**                                         same QC file set, normal side
                                                         (matched mode; e.g. qc/normal/)
```

Normal-side QC is picked up from any `normal/` directory in the tree, wherever the pipeline
nests it, and is also what determines the run mode.

**Small variants come from the VEP annotation only.** `*_SOMATIC_VEP.vcf.gz` defines the
variant set; VAF, depth, genotype and phase set are joined from the VCF that VEP annotated —
`variants/phased/somatic_smallvariants.vcf.gz`. Runs predating `variants/phased/` fall back to
`variants/clairs{,to}/somatic.vcf.gz` (then any non-germline VCF in those directories), which
yields VAF and depth but no phase set. If none is found the table still renders, without
those columns.

VEP writes indels at a different position and sometimes in a different allele notation than
the VCF it was given, so the join is made on a normalised key — see `variant_key()` in
`R/parse_smallvariants.R`.

`*_SOMATIC_VEP.vcf.gz` ships in two formats. Usually it is VEP *default text output* despite
the `.vcf.gz` name. If VEP was run with `--vcf` it is a genuine VCF with a `CSQ` field, and
may be a *merged* multi-caller VCF carrying germline calls (DeepVariant, Clair3) alongside
somatic ones, tagged in `INFO/CALLER`; the report then keeps only `PASS` records from a
somatic caller (ClairS, ClairS-TO, DeepSomatic). Both formats are detected automatically.

Missing files are handled gracefully: the corresponding report section shows a "not available" notice.

### Not covered: methylation

There is no methylation section. The only methylation output the pipeline publishes is
`methylation/<type>/modkit_pileup/<id>.bed.gz` — measured at 38–42 GB gzipped per sample,
unfiltered and with no tabix index, which cannot be read at render time.

`modkit pileup` already runs with `--bgzf`, so emitting a `tabix -p bed` index next to the
`.bed.gz` would be enough to unblock this: region queries on an indexed pileup measured
~0.16 s per Mb, making a binned genome-wide profile or per-locus lookup practical.

## Supported references

| `--reference` | Cytobands source | chr1 length |
|---|---|---|
| `t2t` | CHM13v2.0 | 248,387,328 bp |
| `hg38` | GRCh38 (UCSC) | 248,956,422 bp |

Auto-detection reads `##contig` lines from the VEP somatic VCF.

## R package requirements

Install in your R environment if missing:

```r
install.packages(c("data.table", "dplyr", "tidyr", "DT", "htmltools",
                   "optparse", "quarto", "yaml", "ggplot2", "svglite"))
BiocManager::install(c("circlize", "ComplexHeatmap", "GenomicRanges"))
# paletteer, prismatic are optional (not required by this version)
```

Tested with R 4.4.1 and Quarto 1.5.57.

- **v2**: Nextflow module wrapping this CLI as a final pipeline step
- **v2**: Wakhan haplotype-resolved copy-number integration
