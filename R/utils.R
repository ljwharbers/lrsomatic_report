# Quarto's execute_params as YAML (see bin/render_report.R):
#
#   list(name, path, reference, has_coords, genes,
#        chrom, start, end, interval_gene)   # the last four only when has_coords
#
# `genes` is deduplicated, for symbol matching; the interval vectors are parallel and
# not deduplicated, because one symbol can legitimately carry several loci.
#
# `has_coords` selects the SV matching mode: a panel carrying chrom/start/end is
# matched against SV breakend coordinates with a window (sv_panel_hits()), while a
# symbol-only panel can only be matched against the per-side VEP symbols. Small
# variants always match on `genes` — VEP annotates SNVs reliably, and per-gene
# symbols are the right semantics there — so one file serves both tables.

# Canonical reference names. Panel coordinates are only valid for one reference, so
# a coordinate-carrying panel has to declare which, and the declaration is compared
# against the reference the report was rendered for.
